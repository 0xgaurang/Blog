      <description>Before presenting my talk at SourceZeroCon on Deep Dive into Android Static Analysis, I spent a lot of time understanding WebViews and looked for vulnerable implementations in popular Android applications (mainly applications with 100M+ downloads). One such application was Airtel Thanks where I identified a number of vulnerabilities. This blog post discusses about the high impact vulnerabilities that were reported.
Airtel has fixed these vulnerabilities and it is recommended to update Airtel Thanks application to the latest version from Play Store.</description>
