[{"content":"I have a strong passion for security research, tool automation and Android exploit development. I greatly enjoy finding vulnerabilities in different products and services and reporting these to the respective vendors before such vulnerabilities fall into the wrong hands.\nI love offensive security research, and over the past few years, I have researched several attack vectors in mobile applications. My research led me to author “InsecureShop Vulnerable Android Application”. Also, I have created several “Mobile nuclei templates” to automate vulnerability identification in mobile applications.\nI’m currently working in a product-based firm where I manage their bug bounty program, validate external security submissions, and conduct penetration tests and code reviews on products. Before that, I spent 6 years in a Cyber Security consultancy firm, handling US and Canadian clients. My core responsibility included working on offensive security research projects and performing pentests for client applications.\nEducation Masters (M.Tech) in Cyber Security \u0026amp; Incident Response from National Forensic Sciences University\n","permalink":"https://examplesite.com/about/","summary":"About","title":"About Me 👨🏻‍💻"},{"content":"InsecureShop InsecureShop is an Android application that is designed to be intentionally vulnerable. The aim of creating this app is to teach developers and security professionals about the vulnerabilities that are present in modern Android applications. This also serves as a platform to test your Android pentesting skills.\nLink: https://www.insecureshopapp.com/\nMobile Nuclei Templates The creators of Nuclei tool had recently introduced File requests feature that scans ‘local files’ using matching and extracting capabilities. Taking advantage of this feature, I have created 40+ #nuclei templates to aid mobile security assessments.\nGithub: https://github.com/optiv/mobile-nuclei-templates\nReference (Featured): https://blog.projectdiscovery.io/secret-token-scanning-with-nuclei/\n","permalink":"https://examplesite.com/projects/","summary":"Projects","title":"Projects 📚"}]
